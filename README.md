JHTweet
-------

JHTweet is a simple class for counting characters in a string destined for Twitter, accounting for t.co linking. JHTweet will also render the string with links hyperlinked (currently this does not include @usernames nor #hashtags).

The demo app does a basic Unit Test for each of the link possibilites described at https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tco-url-wrapper/how-twitter-wrap-urls. Currently several of these tests are failing so obviously there is still work to be done.

The goal is to get both the character counting and autolinking functions working correctly for all unit tests as this is the best way to ensure that JHTweet is counting characters the same as Twitter.

Cheers.
